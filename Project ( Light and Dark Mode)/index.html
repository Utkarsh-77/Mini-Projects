        <h1>MS Dhoni History: The Rise, The Career and The Life Beyond</h1>
        <p>
          The atmosphere was epic, and a sense of a breathtaking climax was upon
          us with 10 runs required on the last 2 balls. The largest cricket
          stadium in the world, the Narendra Modi stadium had turned yellow, as
          all fans had come to see one man lift the IPL trophy for the fifth
          time. Mahendra Singh Dhoni sat calmly on his seat in the dugout
          watching as Mohit marked on his run up to bowl to Ravindra Jadeja.
          Tension was palpable as the match was more in the hands of Gujarat
          Titans than CSK. But then came the moment of the tournament, Jadeja
          smashed the last two balls, one for six and the other for a boundary.
          The crowd went into a frenzy, unable to contain their joy. It was the
          legendary MSD who etched his name in history, steering the Chennai
          Super Kings to their record-breaking 5th IPL title. Dhoni, the hero,
          remained calm under immense pressure, leading his team to a glorious
          victory that will be etched cricketing folklore forever.

          All of this felt like a fairy tale a couple of deliveries ago. With 10
          required off 2, it was only a miracle that could steer the match in
          favour of Chennai. It was the prayers of a billion people who wanted
          MSD to bring back that piece of silverware once again, before he said
          goodbye to this lovely sport. But why do people love him so much?
          Coming from a Dhoni fanboy, in this chapter of ZAP Legends, letâ€™s
          decode the life of MSD, and how an ordinary guy, a ticket collector at
          one point in his life, became the most loved person in India.

          MS Dhoni celebrates his birthday on 7th July and was born in the year
          1981 in a small town in Ranchi, Jharkhand. We have all surely watched
          the movie, MS Dhoni-The Untold Story, and already know how a young
          boy, who was a goalkeeper in his school football team found his love
          in cricket. His skills were unmatched and his drive and work ethic all
          led him to where he is today. Quickly climbing up the ladders of the
          domestic cricket circuit, his performances were such that his
          selection for higher levels of the sport were inevitable. He was only
          a few steps away from making his debut for the National team.
